# About OPenPCDet Framework
`OpenPCDet` is a general PyTorch-based codebase for 3D object detection from point cloud. 
It currently supports multiple state-of-the-art 3D object detection methods with highly refactored codes for both one-stage and two-stage 3D detection frameworks.
`OpenPCDet` is an open source project for LiDAR-based 3D scene perception that supports multiple
LiDAR-based perception models as shown above.

### `OpenPCDet` design pattern

* Data-Model separation with unified point cloud coordinate for easily extending to custom datasets:

</p>

* Unified 3D box definition: (x, y, z, dx, dy, dz, heading).

* Flexible and clear model structure to easily support various 3D detection models:
